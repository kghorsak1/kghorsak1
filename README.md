- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @kghorsak1 
- I'm an Architecural Engineering major at UT Austin who has always been interested in coding. I discovered my passion for coding through creating different stock indicators in Highschool via TDAmeritrade's trading platform ThinkorSwim.
- I further delved into the coding realms by taking CS 303e at UT for fun.
- This more structured understanding of coding and my instinctive sense for math led me to work with my statistics TA on a summer research project. This introduced me to the world of university research, big data, and machine learning.
- During the inital AI craze in early 2023 I saw this as an oppurtunity to start coding again and wanted to focus on a practical automation use case and decided to build one from the ground up.
- This has introduced me to popular Github repos like GPT-Engineer and Quivr.
- I find my mind constantly swirling with ideas and I hope to continue coding in some fashion for the forseeable future.
- Through these experiences I have been able to understand the substantial growth of data and automation in recent years and how this will only compound in the years to come.
- I hope to Apply to the UT Master's in Data Science Program come December 2023!
