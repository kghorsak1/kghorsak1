ðŸ‘‹ Hi there, I'm @kghorsak1.

I studied Architectural Engineering at UT Austin and developed a keen interest in coding during my time there. Currently, I'm pursuing a Masterâ€™s in Business Analytics at UT Austin. My coding journey began in high school with creating stock indicators on TDAmeritradeâ€™s ThinkorSwim platform.

For fun, I took CS 303e at UT, which reinforced my coding skills and love for math. This led to a summer research project with my statistics TA, diving into big data and machine learning.

Inspired by these experiences, I tackled a business automation project from the ground up. My GitHub hosts various projects, including text automation for businesses, a customizable Python game, and an image segmentation optimization project. More to come soon!
