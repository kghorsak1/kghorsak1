- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @kghorsak1 
- I'm a previous Architecural Engineering major at UT Austin who has always been interested in coding, I am currently pursuing a Masters in Business Analytics. I discovered my passion for coding through creating different stock indicators in Highschool via TDAmeritrade's trading platform ThinkorSwim.
- I further delved into the coding realms by taking CS 303e at UT for fun.
- This more structured understanding of coding and my instinctive sense for math led me to work with my statistics TA on a summer research project. This introduced me to the world of university research, big data, and machine learning.
- After finding this passion outside of my undergrad major I decided to focus on a practical business automation use case and decided to build one from the ground up.
- Through these experiences I have been able to understand the substantial growth of data and automation in recent years and how this will only compound in the years to come.
- Here on my github I have posted various projects, a partcial business use case of text automation, a simple customizable python game, and an optimization class project focused on image segmentation with more to come!
